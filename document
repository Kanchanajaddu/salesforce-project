 A CRM APPLICATION TO MANAGE DINING SERVICES IN RESTAURANT


This is a thorough process for designing a CRM application to oversee dining services in a restaurant, beginning with the creation of custom objects and ending with the creation of Lightning Web Pages (or comparable dynamic interfaces). This process can be modified for use with bespoke applications, Salesforce, and other CRM platforms..
Application Overview
Goal: Describe the CRM application's primary goal, which is to manage restaurant dining services.
Owners, managers, employees, and patrons of restaurants are the target audience.
Principal modules and their functions are key features:
Profiles of Customers
Bookings
Management of Orders
Loyalty initiatives
Dashboards for Analytics and Feedback Gathering

Social Media Integration
Engage customers by posting deals and promotions on social media automatically.
Comments and Reviews: Provide links to reviews found on websites such as Yelp or Google Reviews.
Social Login: Permit users to log in through Google or Facebook.
Analytics: Monitor social media interactions with customers and examine patterns. 
Detailed Functionalities
Custom Objects
Definition: Special information about the restaurant, including orders, reservations, or loyalty points, is represented by custom objects.
How to Make It:
Go to the CRM platform (such as Salesforce) or system backend's custom object creation page.
Specify the data type, label, and object name.
Configure user access levels and object permissions.
Example:
Create an object named Reservation with fields like:
Customer Name
Date
Time
Number of Guests
Special Requests
Custom Fields
The purpose of adding custom fields to objects is to hold particular information.
How to Make It:
Launch the custom object (Reservation, for example).
Select "Add New Field."
Select the type of field (text, date, picklist, etc.).
If necessary, include a name, label, and default value.
Examples of Fields:
For Customer: Phone Number, Email, Loyalty Points
For Order: Menu Item, Quantity, Total Cost
Dashboards Overview
Dashboards give important metrics a visual representation.
Goals: Track revenue, examine consumer patterns, and keep an eye on performance.
Parts:
Bar charts: Show patterns in monthly revenue.
Pie charts: Display the demographics of your customers.
Line Graphs: Monitor changes in reservations over time.

Steps to Create:
Access the dashboard module in your CRM tool.
Select a data source (e.g., sales data, customer feedback).
Add widgets for visual components (charts, tables).
Customize layout and add filters.
1. Requirement Gathering and Planning
Determine Key Features:
Management of Customers
Order tracking for reservations
Define roles for the Loyalty Program Feedback Collection:
Full access to the system, admin.
Manager: Oversee reservations, orders, and client information.
Employees: Help clients and update orders.
Clients: Self-service options for bookings and comments. 
2. Setting Up the Environment
CRM Tool Selection:
Use a platform like as HubSpot or Salesforce, or create your own using frameworks like Flask, Django, etc.
Salesforce Development Tools: 
Sandbox or Developer Org.
Custom: IDEs such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.
Setting up the database for Salesforce: 
Make use of both bespoke and standard objects.
Regarding Custom: Install databases (such as PostgreSQL and MySQL). 

3. Creating Custom Objects
Custom objects will store specific data entities related to restaurant management.
Objects to Create:
Customer: For customer profiles.
Reservation: To handle table bookings.
Order: To track placed orders.
Feedback: To record customer reviews.
Loyalty: To manage points and rewards.
Steps in Salesforce:
Go to Setup → Object Manager → Create Object.
Define the object label, plural label, and data type.
Configure permissions and access.
4. Adding Custom Fields
Custom fields enhance objects with specific attributes.
Examples:
Customer: Phone, Email, Loyalty Points.
Reservation: Table Number, Date, Time, Guests, Status.
Order: Item Name, Quantity, Price, Total.
Feedback: Rating, Comments, Feedback Date.
Steps in Salesforce:
Open the custom object → Click Fields & Relationships → New Field.
Choose the field type (e.g., Text, Number, Picklist).
Set the label, name, and validation rules.
5. Automating Processes with Workflow Rules
Tasks like recording updates and sending notifications can be automated with the use of workflow rules.

Examples of Use:

Send a reservation reminder via email.
After the order is completed, update the loyalty points.
In Salesforce, follow these steps: Select Setup → Workflow Rules → New Rule.
Choose the item (Reservation, for example).
Establish criteria (e.g., tomorrow is the reservation date).
Include actions (such as an update field or email alert).


6. Using Process Builder to Implement Complicated Workflows
Workflow rules are less flexible than Process Builder.

Use Case For instance:

Update the Order object to "Completed" once a customer has finished placing their order.
Incorporate loyalty points into the customer's file.
A "Thank You" email should be sent.
In Salesforce, follow these steps: Select Setup > Process Builder → New Process.
Choose the item and set the triggers.
Define tasks, email alerts, and record updates, among other things.


7. Building Lightning Web Components (LWC) or UI Pages
For a dynamic and user-friendly interface, create Lightning Web Components or equivalent web pages.
Pages to Create:
Home Page: Overview of daily operations, upcoming reservations, and analytics.
Reservation Page: Display reservation details with actions like cancel or modify.
Order Page: Show orders in progress with options to update status.
Feedback Page: List customer feedback for review.
9. Creating Reports and Dashboards
Dashboards provide insights into restaurant performance.
Examples:
Total Reservations by Month.
Revenue from Orders.
Customer Loyalty Statistics.
Steps in Salesforce:
Go to Reports → New Report.
Choose a report type (e.g., Reservation).
Add filters, groupings, and charts.
Save the report and add it to a dashboard.
10. Security and Access Management
Ensure proper access controls to protect sensitive data.
Roles and Permissions:
Admin: Full access.
Manager: Manage reservations and orders.
Staff: View assigned tasks and update orders.
Customer: Access self-service features.
Steps in Salesforce:
Define roles in Setup → Roles.
Assign profiles and permissions to each role.
